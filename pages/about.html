    How we began
  </h2>
  <p>
    We're a group of passionate travellers who realised that there must be a better way to do this. There are so many things to consider when booking your trip, and all this information is spread out across the travel books, agents and the web. This makes finding those true hidden gems a nearly impossible task - especially with limited time and money.
    We decided to combine our years of experience and various expertise to create a truly unique travel experience, allowing our intrepid travellers to bypass the 'tourist' experience and get to the heart of their destination, whilst keeping to their budgets.
  </p>
  <h2>
    We know what we're talking about
  </h2>
  <p>
    Collectively we have over 50 years experience in the travel industry, and have personally experienced every destination and activity promoted here.

  You're in safe hands

  Unique Travel is a fully licensed and bonded tour operator. We hold an Air Travel Organisers Licence (ATOL) no. 2582 issued by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), and we are bonded with the CAA. Our ATOL bond covers all holidays which include air travel. In the event of our financial failure before departure, all monies paid, except insurance premiums, will be refunded. If failure occurs while you are on your trip, the bond administrators will first of all attempt to apply the funds to complete your trip, or if this is not possible, they will ensure that you are repatriated to the UK. Should the bond be insufficient, back-up funds are available through the CAA. Our membership of this organisation means that our accounts are subject to regular and stringent independent scrutiny, which, although it cannot prevent failure, certainly makes it less likely. You can book with Unique Travel in complete confidence that all monies paid to us for trips are fully protected.
